This project is for a fictional private space travel company called Flight. The website was built using HTML and SCSS to demonstrate intermediate and advanced level front-end web development techniques.

## Notes
I am currently building Flight Architect, a React-based tours builder for this website that will allow users to customize their package prior to launch.

Also note that this is an in-development project. Below are some of the upcoming additions:

* Add animations to Tours section along with pricing information
* Completed footer
* Navigation
